2. Graphs
3. Segment Trees
4. Fenwick Trees
5. Tries
6. Bit Manipulation
7. String Matching (KMP/Z-Function)

ðŸ“‹ Extensive materials for learning & practicing all of the above-mentioned DSA topics are shared 
in the first comment. 


This post, along with my learnings, contains knowledge from several recent 
Google phone-screen interviews given by my friends and connections. A huge thank-you to 
every one of you all for your help in compiling this resource!!
